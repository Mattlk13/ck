# Common Metadata eXchange (CMX)

The [CMX automation framework](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cmx) 
facilitates the decomposition of complex software systems and benchmarks such as MLPerf
into portable, reusable, and interconnected automation recipes for MLOps and DevOps. 
These recipes are developed and continuously improved by the community.

***Starting in 2025, CMX V4.0.0 serves as drop-in, backward-compatible replacement 
   for the earlier [Collective Mind framework (CM)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm)
   and other MLCommons automation prototypes, while providing a simpler and more robust interface.***

CMX is a lightweight, Python-based toolset that provides a unified
command-line interface (CLI), a Python API, and minimal dependencies.
It is designed to help researchers and engineers automate repetitive,
time-consuming tasks such as building, running, benchmarking, and
optimizing AI, machine learning, and other applications across diverse and
constantly evolving models, data, software, and hardware.

CMX is continuously enhanced through public and private Git repositories,
providing automation recipes and artifacts.
