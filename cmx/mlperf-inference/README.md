# MLPerf automations

[Collective Mind automation framework (CM and CMX)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm) 
have helped [the community](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) 
learn how to modularize and automate MLPerf inference benchmarks
through [unified MLOps and MLPerf automations with extensible metadata](https://access.cknowledge.org/playground/?action=scripts).

Here, we maintain an archive of various unified CM and CMX commands for running different versions of MLPerf benchmarks.

You can also check the [CM/CMX commands](https://github.com/aryatschand/MLPerf-Power-HPCA-2025/blob/main/measurement_tutorial.md) 
to run experiments from the [HPCA'25 paper "MLPerf Power: Benchmarking the Energy Efficiency of Machine Learning Systems from Microwatts to Megawatts for Sustainable AI"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12032).
